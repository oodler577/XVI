This is just a dump of the things I've knocked out during this initial
code phase to create a working strawman:

; - <esc>x needs to replicate the behavior that it if the remainder
; --- of the line is blank, the cursor itself shifts left rather than
; --- the contents of the line - may require an "end of line" character??
; ---- solution was to return length of rstrip'd line in redraw_line sub, then make the
; ---- cursor follow the last printable character in the line
; - o/O + Replace mode is causing weird line redraw
; --- successive <enter> should create more lines and not leave Replace mode,
; --- but it's exacerbating VRAM corruption
; ---- fix ended up being forcing a clean line to print in the redraw_line sub w/strings.rstrip
; - address remaining artifacts and inconsistencies in do_dd's paging and cursor placement ***
; - o/O (or equivalent) should leave editor in (R)eplace mode
; - :w filetosave.txt
; - w - blocks if file exists,
; - foo.txt causes memory overflow (end line was doubling the space taken up in memory)
; - q - block quit if no save since last time?
; - w! filename.txt (bug exposed, nav on j stops at some point in the screen)
; - main.lineCount is getting truncated or reset somehow
; ---- used main.lineCount, there might still be a bug between strings.slice + Document.lineCount
; - make sure existing file is overwritten on forced save ...
; - q! - force quit
; - fixed o, O, p, P - made them consistent with cursor and paging behavior
; - fixed scrolling bug with dd on last page
; - replace character mode <esc>r
; - replace mode <esc>R ... then <esc> to end
