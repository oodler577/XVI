This is just a dump of the things I've knocked out during this initial
code phase to create a working strawman:

; PARTIALLY DONE:
; - implement flag-based "do stuff" idea for alerts (from Tony)

; DONE

; - implemented wq, wq! (NEED to add checks around it)
; - ":w<enter>" on splash screen puts the editor in a hung or weird stated
; - getting closer to sane handling of opening :e, :e filename, :e filenotfound
; -- also fixed if in a modified buffer, a new buffer is not created if "e: filenotfound"
; - disallow ":e" (new buffer) if another buffer is already active
; -- unless :e! is used - this works on all cases, including changes files
; - implemented D
; - added a bottom status that is more familiar to vim users, CTRL+g now
; -- triggers a "verbose" status mode on/off (shows old bottom status, which
; -- was more verbose
; - ZZ now checks to make sure doc.filepath is set - not true if just editing
; -- a buffer
; - make start up to edit a file or buffer more familiar
; - added  A, I, i, 1G, G, x, dd, yy, R, r, ZZ, :q! (Sam's set)
; - i,a now delete like vim; it was carrying a character incorrectly
; - p,P are buggy, "pastes the line in minus the whitespace at the start"
; - g leaves reverse character
; - O bug when on line 1
; - on clean exit, turn ISO
; - added Y
; - delete swap file after saving
; - get crash and monitor prompt at the end of the document in some case;
; -- need to figure out how to reproduce it (haven't gotten it in a while)
; - fixed issue where I,i,a,A were not preserving vim's behavior to not delete
; -- the cursor character when it hit the left most margin while in nav mode
; - added Y
; - harden save_as against never stopping the save (infinite loop?)
; - <esc>+O leaves a cursor artifact
; - reproduce issue with save_as never stopping
; - (PRIORITY) insert mode  <esc>i (most commonly used writing mode)
; -- build on current functionality of 'i' which is to shift right and insert space
; - ^,$  (jump to line start, line end) both do not properly replace the letter under the cursor
; -- got fixed somehow, but it works now
; - use 'R' mode over and over again - record and triage bugs
; -- fixed backspace issue, got it indistinguishable (right now) to how it works
; -- in vim
; - also add 'a', which is going to append to the right of the current x,y
; - made cursor be placed more like vim does it, based on line ending and the
; -- current "default_col"
; - (BUG) when in 'R' mode, entering in double quotes (") breaks replace mode
; -- due to "quotes mode", solution is to cbm.CHROUT($80) first if char == $22 (quote)
; -- then cbm.CHROUT($22) ...
; - saving now detects last visible character, and adds new line in the file there
; - 'i' now inserts a space and shifts right
; - add mode status, e.g., "-- REPLACE --" / "-- INSERT --" when in the correct modes
; - ALERTs need to be non-blocking (probably need to use interrupts?)
; - "shift left" for 'x'
; - o/O need an efficient redraw routine for section affected by shift-down
; see CHANGELOG for full archive of items
; - trying to get <return> when in REPLACE mode working, see BUGS
;   - can't get <return> to do the right thing when in REPLACE mode; i.e.,
;   -- I want it to save the current line, do the equivalent of 'o' (insert
;   -- line after), and return back to edit mode (replace or insert, whatever
;   -- it was)
; - :e on splash to start new document buffer (PRIORITY)
; - <esc>x needs to replicate the behavior that it if the remainder
; --- of the line is blank, the cursor itself shifts left rather than
; --- the contents of the line - may require an "end of line" character??
; ---- solution was to return length of rstrip'd line in redraw_line sub, then make the
; ---- cursor follow the last printable character in the line
; - o/O + Replace mode is causing weird line redraw
; --- successive <enter> should create more lines and not leave Replace mode,
; --- but it's exacerbating VRAM corruption
; ---- fix ended up being forcing a clean line to print in the redraw_line sub w/strings.rstrip
; - address remaining artifacts and inconsistencies in do_dd's paging and cursor placement ***
; - o/O (or equivalent) should leave editor in (R)eplace mode
; - :w filetosave.txt
; - w - blocks if file exists,
; - foo.txt causes memory overflow (end line was doubling the space taken up in memory)
; - q - block quit if no save since last time?
; - w! filename.txt (bug exposed, nav on j stops at some point in the screen)
; - main.lineCount is getting truncated or reset somehow
; ---- used main.lineCount, there might still be a bug between strings.slice + Document.lineCount
; - make sure existing file is overwritten on forced save ...
; - q! - force quit
; - fixed o, O, p, P - made them consistent with cursor and paging behavior
; - fixed scrolling bug with dd on last page
; - replace character mode <esc>r
; - replace mode <esc>R ... then <esc> to end
